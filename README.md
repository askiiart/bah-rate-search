# BAH rate search

This downloads BAH rates and searches them by ZIP code. To use it:

1. Replace `YEAR` with the current year, or whichever year's data you want to use. The default is `2023`.
2. Replace `PAY_GRADE` with your pay grade. The default is `E-5`.
3. Set `DEPENDENTS` to `True` or `False` depending on whether you have dependents. The default is `False`.
4. Run the script with the ZIP code you want to search. For example, `python3 bah-rate-search.py 90210` or `./bah-rate-search.py 90210`.
